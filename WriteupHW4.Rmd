# **Problem 1 - Iron Bank**

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The null hypothesis states that the rate at which
Iron Bank employees’ trades are flagged matches the SEC’s baseline rate
of 2.4%. In other words, any deviation from this rate is due to random
variability rather than systematic insider trading.

Test Statistic We use the number of flagged trades out of 2021 total
trades as our test statistic. Under the null hypothesis, the number of
flagged trades should follow a binomial distribution: Binomial(n =
2021,p = 0.024) where:

-   n = 2021 is the total number of trades

-   p= 0.024 is the probability that any given trade is flagged.

Monte Carlo Simulation & Probability Distribution: To assess whether the
observed number of 70 flagged trades is significantly higher than
expected:

We perform 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations, each drawing a random sample
from Bin(2021,0.024)

We generate a probability distribution of flagged trades under the null
hypothesis. We compute the p-value, which represents the proportion of
simulations where the number of flagged trades is 70 or more. The
following plot illustrates the simulated probability distribution of
flagged trades, assuming the null hypothesis is true:

P-Value: The p-value quantifies how likely it is to observe 70 or more
flagged trades if the null hypothesis were true. From our Monte Carlo
simulation:

-   p = Proportion of simulations where flagged trades ≥ 70

-   p = = 0.00212

Conclusion: Since the p-value (0.00212) is very small (p \< 0.05
significance threshold), this suggests that the observed number of
flagged trades (70) is highly unlikely to occur under the null
hypothesis. This provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis
and suggests that Iron Bank employees may be engaging in suspicious
trading patterns that deviate from normal behavior.

Given this statistical evidence, the SEC has reasonable grounds to
investigate Iron Bank further for potential insider trading.

# Problem 2 - Health Inspections

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The null hypothesis states that Gourmet Bites
restaurants are cited for health code violations at the same 3% baseline
rate as other restaurants in the city. That is, any deviation from this
rate is due to random variation rather than systematic differences in
health code compliance.

Test Statistic: We use the number of Gourmet Bites restaurants cited for
health violations out of 50 total inspections as our test statistic.
Under the null hypothesis, this should follow a binomial distribution:

Binomial(n=50,p=0.03) where:

-   n=50 is the total number of Gourmet Bites restaurant inspections,

-   p=0.03 is the probability that any given restaurant is cited for a
    health violation.

Monte Carlo Simulation & Probability Distribution: To determine whether
the observed number of 8 health violations is significantly higher than
expected:

We perform 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations, each drawing a random sample
from Bin(50,0.03). We generate a probability distribution of health
violations under the null hypothesis. We compute the p-value, which
represents the proportion of simulations where the number of violations
is 8 or more. The following plot illustrates the simulated probability
distribution of health violations, assuming the null hypothesis is true:

![](hw4problem2graph.png)

P-Value: The p-value quantifies how likely it is to observe 8 or more
health violations if the null hypothesis were true.

From our Monte Carlo simulation:

-   p = Proportion of simulations where violations ≥ 8

-   p = 0.00017

Conclusion: Since the p-value (0.00017) is extremely small, this
suggests that the observed number of health violations (8) is highly
unlikely to occur under the null hypothesis. The probability of this
happening by random chance is less than 0.02%, providing very strong
evidence against the null hypothesis.

This result suggests that Gourmet Bites restaurants may have a
significantly higher violation rate than the city’s average. The Health
Department has strong grounds for further investigation to determine
whether Gourmet Bites locations have systematic issues with health code
compliance.

# Problem 3: Evaluating Jury Selection for Bias

Null Hypothesis (H₀): The null hypothesis states that the distribution
of jurors en-paneled by this judge matches the county’s population
proportions. In other words, any observed deviations are due to random
chance rather than systematic bias in jury selection.

Test Statistic: We use the Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test to compare
the observed jury selection distribution with the expected distribution
based on the county’s population proportions. The test statistic is: χ²
= Σ((O - E)² / E)

This test determines whether the observed jury selection is
significantly different from what would be expected if jurors were
selected proportionally to the population.

Monte Carlo Simulation & Probability Distribution: To assess whether the
observed jury selection is significantly different from the expected
proportions:

We compute the Chi-Square statistic for the observed and expected
counts. We determine the p-value, which represents the probability of
obtaining a Chi-Square statistic as extreme as (or more extreme than)
the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The following
plot illustrates the Chi-Square distribution under the null hypothesis,
with the observed test statistic marked:

![](hw4problem3graph.png)

Results:

-   Chi-square statistic = 12.42639
-   p = 0.01445

Conclusion Since the p-value (0.01445) is below the 0.05 significance
threshold, this suggests that the observed jury selection distribution
is significantly different from the county’s population proportions.
This provides stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating
that systematic bias may exist in jury selection.

However, other explanations are possible. The discrepancy might arise
due to random fluctuations, non-random selection biases (e.g., juror
availability, exemptions, or procedural factors), or systemic issues
like misrepresentation due to economic or social factors.

Further Investigation To better understand the cause of this deviation,
we could:

-   Examine Jury Selection Procedures: Analyze whether juror selection
    methods disproportionately exclude certain demographic groups.

-   Look at Historical Data: Compare this judge’s jury selection against
    juries selected by other judges in the same county.

-   Conduct Surveys or Interviews: Gather data on factors affecting
    juror participation (e.g., financial hardship, difficulty getting
    excused, or language barriers).

# Problem 4: LLM watermarking

## Part A:

Calculating the Null Distribution Null Hypothesis (H₀): The null
hypothesis states that each sentence follows the typical English letter
distribution. Any deviations from this distribution are assumed to be
due to random variation rather than systematic alterations, such as LLM
watermarking.

Reference Distribution: We calculated the expected English letter
frequency distribution from a reference corpus. This distribution serves
as our null distribution, allowing us to compare each sentence’s letter
frequencies against expected values.

Building the Null Distribution:

-   A reference Chi-Square distribution was generated using sentences
    from the Brown Corpus, which follows natural English letter
    frequency.

-   Chi-Square test statistic was calculated for each sentence in the
    Brown Corpus:

-   The computed null distribution of the Chi-Square statistic has the
    following summary:

## Part B: 

Null Hypothesis (H₀):

The null hypothesis states that each sentence follows the typical
English letter distribution. Any deviations from this distribution are
assumed to be due to random variation rather than systematic
alterations, such as LLM watermarking.

Identifying the Watermarked Sentence:

The most suspicious sentence is:

Sentence 6: "Feeling vexed after an arduous and zany day at work, she
hoped for a peaceful and quiet evening at home, cozying up after a quick
dinner with some TV, or maybe a book on her upcoming visit to Auckland."

Evidences:

-   Sentence 6 has the highest Chi-Square value (39.04543), indicating
    that its letter frequency significantly deviates from normal
    English.

-   The p-value for Sentence 6 (0.259) is the lowest, meaning it is the
    least likely to be naturally generated text.

-   The other sentences have p-values close to 0.5 or higher, suggesting
    their letter distributions are in line with typical English text.

-   Since Sentence 6 deviates the most, it is the most likely to have
    been LLM-watermarked by subtly adjusting letter frequencies.

Conclusion:

Since Sentence 6 has the lowest p-value (0.259) and the highest
Chi-Square statistic (39.04543), we conclude that this sentence was
produced by an LLM and watermarked by adjusting letter frequencies. The
statistical evidence strongly suggests that its letter distribution
deviates from normal English patterns more than any other sentence.
